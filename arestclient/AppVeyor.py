class AppVeyor(API):
    """
    The agnostic AppVeyor API. It doesn't know, and you don't care.
    >>> from arestclient.AppVeyor import AppVeyor
    >>> ci = AppVeyor('<your AppVeyor API token>')
    >>> status, data = ci.api.projects.get()
    >>> data
    ... [ list_, of, stuff ]

    >>> status, data = ci.api.projects.topic2k.eventghost.get()
    >>> data
    ... { 'project': <project data>, }

    >>> account_name = 'topic2k'
    >>> project_slug = 'eventghost'
    >>> status, data = ci.api.projects[account_name][project_slug].get()
    ... same as above

    >>> status, data = ci.api.projects.topic2k.eventghost.buildcache.delete()
    >>> status
    ... 204

    That's all there is to it. (blah.post() should work, too.)

    NOTE: It is up to you to spell things correctly. An AppVeyor object
    doesn't even try to validate the url you feed it. On the other hand,
    it automatically supports the full API--so why should you care?
